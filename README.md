# Indeed-Salary-Predictions

Project 4 at General Assembly's London Data Science Immersive.  

We were asked to use web scraping to collect data from Indeed to address the question: You're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Now that they have their most valuable employee (you!), they need to leverage data to win more contracts. Your firm offers technology and scientific solutions and wants to be competitive in the hiring market. Your principal wants you to determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts for these data.
